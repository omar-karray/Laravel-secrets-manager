Laravel Vault Suite connects your Laravel applications to dedicated secrets backends such as HashiCorp Vault and OpenBao. It ships with an extensible driver system, an expressive facade, and artisan tooling so you can read, write, and manage secrets without copying values into `.env` files.

ðŸ“˜ Documentation: https://omar-karray.github.io/laravel-vault-suite/

## Features

- **Command-first operations** â€“ Ship-ready Artisan commands (`vault:unseal`, `vault:enable-engine`, â€¦) for the tasks operators and developers run every day.
- **Fluent PHP API** â€“ Fetch, write, list, and delete secrets through a clean service/facade when you need programmatic access.
- **Multi-backend driver manager** â€“ Vault and OpenBao out of the box with an extensible contract for additional backends.
- **Configuration & bootstrap blueprint** â€“ Centralise driver settings today and hydrate Laravel configuration at runtime as the bootstrapper lands.
- **Documentation site** â€“ [Guides on GitHub Pages](https://omar-karray.github.io/laravel-vault-suite/) cover installation, commands, configuration, and the API surface.

## Installation

```bash
composer require deepdigs/laravel-vault-suite
```

Publish the configuration file to tailor drivers and bootstrap behaviour:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="vault-suite-config"
```

Add the relevant environment variables in your `.env` file (or server configuration):

```dotenv
VAULT_SUITE_DRIVER=vault
VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
VAULT_TOKEN=your-root-or-app-token
VAULT_ENGINE_MOUNT=secret
VAULT_ENGINE_VERSION=2
```

## Usage

Read a secret as an array:

```php
use Deepdigs\LaravelVaultSuite\Facades\LaravelVaultSuite;

$database = LaravelVaultSuite::fetch('apps/laravel/database');
```

Read a specific key from the secret payload:

```php
$password = LaravelVaultSuite::fetch('apps/laravel/database', 'password');
```

Write or update a secret:

```php
LaravelVaultSuite::put('apps/laravel/database', [
    'username' => 'laravel',
    'password' => 'new-password',
]);
```

List secret keys beneath a path:

```php
$keys = LaravelVaultSuite::list('apps/laravel');
```

## Artisan commands

- `vault:unseal` â€“ Submit key shards (from CLI or a file) and track progress until Vault is unsealed.
  ```bash
  php artisan vault:unseal --file=storage/keys/unseal.txt --reset
  ```
- `vault:enable-engine` â€“ Mount and configure secrets engines with typed options.
  ```bash
  php artisan vault:enable-engine secret/apps --option=version=2 --local
  ```

See [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md) for the full option reference.

## Local development

- Use a multi-root VS Code workspace that includes this package and your Laravel app.
- Register the package as a [Composer path repository](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path) for hot-linked development.
- Only run `composer update deepdigs/laravel-vault-suite` after changing this packageâ€™s `composer.json` or autoloading configuration.
- When tagging for production use, publish to Packagist and update your application to use the release tag instead of the path repository.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
